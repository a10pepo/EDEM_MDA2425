# 👋 Hey there! I'm Jorge Moltó

I'm a **Data & AI Consultant** at **Nunsys Group** 🧑‍💻, where I play with data to create magic for businesses. I also hold a double degree in **Computer Engineering** and **Business Administration** (because why settle for just one?). I'm always looking for new ways to blend tech with real-world problems to solve them efficiently.

## 🚀 About me

I love building **BI solutions** like they’re giant puzzles 🧩, and I get a kick out of digging into **Machine Learning** to find hidden patterns 🔍. I’ve also spent some time helping an online pet accessory store shine in the digital world with **marketing strategies** 💻.

But it’s not all about work… I was a professional athlete until 2021! 🏃‍♂️

## 🛠️ Tools of the Trade

- **SQL** to chat with databases 🤖  
- **Power BI** and **Qlik** to turn numbers into beautiful charts 📊  
- **SSIS** and **ADF** to handle ETL (not a spaceship, but close 🚀)  
- **Online Marketing** to make websites take off (SEO, SEM, the whole deal) 🌐

## 🎯 What I do when I’m not working

- I made **50+ YouTube videos** about music 🎸, racking up **130,000 views** (yes, music is another passion of mine).
- **Volunteering**: I guided a Paralympic athlete with the ONCE and did humanitarian work for refugees in Poland. Helping others is always top 💙.
- I’m obsessed with learning: from **stoicism** to personal productivity. There’s no day I’m not trying to improve (although I do procrastinate sometimes… it’s part of the journey! 😅).

## 🌍 Languages I Speak (or try to)

- **Spanish**: Master level 🧙‍♂️  
- **English**: I get by (B2) 🇬🇧  
- **Valencian**: Nivell molt alt! (C1) 🌊  
- **Italian**: Just enough to survive dinner in Italy 🍝

## 🔮 What’s next for me?

I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities. If you have an exciting project (or just want to talk about data, tech, productivity, or music), feel free to reach out!
