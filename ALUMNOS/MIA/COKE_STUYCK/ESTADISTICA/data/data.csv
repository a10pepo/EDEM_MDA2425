The plaque bearing his name is almost unique, recognising his life’s work by using the iconic London Underground typeface that he helped to design.<br /><br />This classically elegant Grade II Listed freehold house was built by J.J Stevenson, master of the Queen Anne revival style, between 1896 and 1898, and retains many of its original features. Located on “one of Mayfair’s most architecturally beautiful streets,” it provides an impressive family home with its six sumptuous bedrooms and a lavish space for entertaining with ceiling heights of 3.5m in the formal reception rooms. Its two rear balconies offer magnificent views over Mount Street Gardens, which pre-date the house by nine years and house a variety of exotic plants including a Canary Island date palm and three dawn redwoods from China.<br /><br />The house is laid out over seven levels, comprising lower ground, ground and five upper floors connected by an impressive cantilevered staircase and offers a breathtaking example of Queen Anne Revival Style architecture. Guided by the Victorian obsession with looking back and seeking to improve styles of the British past, the architect Stevenson emulated the grand buildings of Queen Anne’s reign designing with a focus on classical beauty - balance, harmony and light. As a result the house is characterised by high ceilings, impressive windows and elegant cornicing to achieve an effect of symmetry and order.<br /><br />The lower ground floor contains an impressive family kitchen/dining room with a large central island, aga-style ovens and a great ornate fireplace. To the front there are staff quarters and an assortment of storage rooms and facilities. The ground floor has an entrance hall with diamond-patterned marble flooring, and leading off it are the elegant study with bay windows and grand formal dining room capable of seating eighteen guests. Like many rooms in the house, it benefits from a stately original marble fireplace, ceiling cornicing and impressive windows.<br /><br />The first floor contains a huge drawing room and enormous 11m x 4m reception room with high ceiling and floor-to-ceiling windows, while the second is dominated by the extravagant principal bedroom suite.

"31/10/2024","7 bedroom detached house for sale in Ingram Avenue, NW11","An elegant detached residence which stands out as a landmark property.<br /><br />The inspiration for Fairwood House came from Sir Edwin Lanseer Lutyens, the 20th Century’s leading British architect. Lutyens was commissioned to design many of the great English country houses as well being appointed by the government to design and build Viceroy House in Delhi, which has since become the residence of the President of India.<br /><br />This imposing property, spanning 9,350 Sq Ft (868 Sq M) over 4 floors, enjoys a double plot, which measures around 0.6 acres, faces due south to the rear of the property and also backs on to Turners Wood – a 7 Acre private bird sanctuary. In 2006, the property was completely rebuilt behind the original facade to create a house fit for the twenty-first century whilst ensuring that the layout remained loyal to the original that Lutyens created. All of the principal reception rooms on the ground floor are facing the extensive gardens, are inter-connected and at the rear of the property, providing excellent flow and family living accommodation. On the upper floors, there are 8 bedroom suites, including the principal with dual dressing rooms and bathrooms. <br /><br />The house is endowed with exceptionally high ceilings. Most of the rooms on the ground floor enjoy ceiling heights in excess of 3.3 metres and some rise to well over 4 metres. <br /><br />The house is a true thoroughbred in the best traditions of past master builders, rarely seen today. The dignified but unconventional frontage is crafted of the finest handmade grey and red brickwork that gives life to the elevations. Imposing chimneystacks, two niches situated at ground floor level, and a swan’s neck pediment that stands above the front entrance complete the frontage of this imposing grade II listed home. The house wears its elegance lightly without striving for effect and without the need for superfluous columns or porticoes.<br /><br />Lutyens was commissioned to provide drawings for the elevations by Reginald McKenna, Chair<br /><br />","Detached","9300","7","10","new","£11,000,000"

"Reduced on 11/04/2024","6 bedroom detached house for sale in Granville Park, London, SE13","Imposing even when it was built in 1853 as a double-fronted detached home, it’s now triple-fronted and set well back from the road with views across the heath, complete with gated entrance, ample parking, double garage and a meticulously-restored exterior. The exterior comprises renovated London Stock Brickwork, beautiful bathstone balustrades, newly installed sash windows, and 60,000 reclaimed London Stock yellow bricks to create the new perimeter walls and substantial extension. Indications of the sympathetic restoration are the refurbished original steel horse post and repurposed original hay baskets as a planting feature.<br />The house totals nearly 9,000 sq ft, over 3,000 sq ft of this is hidden from the front elevation, there are six to seven bedrooms, five bathrooms, staff quarters, and multiple entertaining spaces across four floors.<br />The pristine exterior is testament to the three-year renovation undertaken by the house’s architect owner and the imaginative, exquisite interiors are equally impressive. This house is his latest expression of nearly thirty years of specialised restorations of Victorian Villas.<br />The grand entrance way with stained glass and beautiful corniced ceiling details leads through to an L-shaped triple reception space featuring Versaille oak parquet flooring, high ceilings, original fireplaces, ornate ceiling roses and cornicing. Large floor-to-ceiling sash windows provide views across the south facing 200 ft rear garden. This floor is complete with a generous fitted boot and cloakroom and WC.<br />There is multiple access to the lower floors but the most inventive and fun is the concealed bookcase doorway, operated via one of the display books. This reveals a stairway lined with exposed brickwork and irrigated living wall spawning three floors. There is a study and access to the garage on the remainder of the ground floor and a spiral staircase leads you to the entertainment room upstairs and spa, orangery and kitchens downstairs. Glass viewing panes in the floors assist with light and add a further fun element to this serious and expansive house.<br />The entertainment room has fantastic views across the heath towards Canary Wharf and over the rear garden and features a double height glass topped void, exposed brickwork, bar area, high tech in wall gas fireplace, and unofficial rooftop terrace providing maintenance access to the twin commercial boilers. Downstairs is perhaps the most indulgent feature of the house in the shape of the hotel worthy spa.<br />The spa benefits from a Himalayan salt sauna with infra-red treatment, further steam room with colour changing mood lighting, swimming pool with jet system,  spa jacuzzi, two 3.5m linked cinema screens, state of the art sound system, which continues throughout the house, and seating area with bar. There is the option for a gym in this space if one removes the seating area, and the screens present an ideal cinema setting too.<br />Opposite the spa, to the south of the house, we have an Orangery with 4.5-metre high glass ceilings, exposed brickwork, wood burning stove, and Crittall doors leading to the expansive outdoor dining terrace or down the wide paved steps, past the koi carp pond down to the garden.<br />The landscaped garden reaches 200 ft and faces south west. There is a terrace and entertaining area separate from the lawn with a viewing window pond separating this from the main garden. The lawn section of the garden boasts a wilderness meadow garden and a studio to the rear ideal for an home office or artist’s studio. <br />The view of the back of the property is arguably more impressive than the front and gives a real sense of the scale of the house. An all-new external cast iron spiral staircase provides access to an elevated Victorian verandah.<br />Heading back into the house from the garden there is a bespoke kitchen with island, soft-close units, high-end appliances including a Lacanche Range cooker and American fridge. There is a generous walk-in pantry, utility room, wine cellar and laundry room. Staff quarters are to the east of this floor, comprising a large studio with kitchen, wet-room shower and toilet facilities with separate access from the front of the property and direct access to the rear garden.  This area has also been designed to accommodate a wheelchair-dependent person, gaining access to the whole garden, dining, orangery and spa areas, and the whole of the ground floor reception rooms via the external lift.<br />Moving upstairs via the stone staircase and past the stained glass side terrace, the top two floors showcase the other bedrooms.<br />The principal suite on the first floor is undoubtedly the highlight, the same period features we saw in the reception, views over the fabulous gardens and heath, en-suite bathroom with reclaimed tub, separate rainfall shower, and discreet Japanese toilet. A walk through closet completes the suite; this can be accessed from both the main suite and the hallway.<br />The first floor is complete with another main bathroom and bedroom. The top floor is self-contained with four more bedrooms, two bathrooms, and an additional kitchen. Ideal as a floor for growing children distinctly separated from the “adults” first floor.<br />It should also be noted that the house is entirely accessible with an exterior lift for those who require it, this is multi propose and can be used for convenient deliveries via the service entrance, as well as garden access and maintenance.<br />An imposing yet discreet and secure family home. <br />An entirely unique opportunity to acquire a stand out property renovated to state of the art standards, for sale chain free.<br />A mansion, a literal piece of art south of the river with ideal connections across town.<br /><br /><b>Situation</b><br /><br />Granville House provides a lovely stroll down Eliott Vale to picturesque Blackheath village, past imposing terraces of Georgian and Victorian villas to the right and ancient open heath grasslands to the left. The bustling village itself plays host to numerous boutiques, restaurants, pavement cafés and bars and has a vibe of gentler, past times. Alternatively, a stroll diagonally across the grassland heath takes you to the historically important Rangers House, the gateway into ancient Royal Greenwich Park, down past the Royal Observatory, the Meridian Line, Queens House and Royal Maritime museum, and on towards Sir Christopher Wren’s Royal Naval Hospital (aka Greenwich University). <br />Greenwich itself hosts an ancient indoor market, the Cutty Sark, numerous bars ,cafés and restaurants, and a DLR link to Canary wharf and beyond. There is also a fast river boat ferry service to London every 10 minutes.<br /> The overground train hub of Lewisham Station is around half a mile away, providing fast trains to London Bridge in 8 minutes, Waterloo in 12 minutes, Charing Cross in 18 minutes and Cannon Street in 16 minutes.

It is approached by a number of steps leading up to an imposing entrance with a solid oak door encased by brick detailing.  The façade of the house protrudes at the centre in an elegant manner that symbolises the integral nature of architectural design during this period.  There are a number of double hung sash windows complete with secondary glazing throughout.  This feature ensures an abundance of natural light is present in the property. The house has a mansard roof complete with dormer windows, a parapet and two impressive chimney stacks finely finishing the façade of this beautifully presented building. Upon entering, a number of key features can be seen, most notably an imposing drawing room that spans the width of the first floor with 3 windows, a formal dining room laid out on the ground floor, a spacious master bedroom suite arranged on the second and a generously-sized private garden to the rear. It is enriched with character and exudes elegance.<br /><br />The house enjoys historic views at the front over the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey and the gardens of Westminster School.<br /><br />Historical Background<br /><br />Great College Street was laid out from c.1720, along the old south boundary of Thorney Island, still defined on the north side by the stone wall of c.1374-6 to the Abbey Garden.  The south side mixes early 18th century houses and early 20th century houses and offices. <br /><br />Previous Occupants and Owners<br /><br />The earliest occupants were members of a family named Dwyer.  Thomas Dwyer, a City merchant who traded with Russia, and owned Great College Street in 1744. In the course of time it passed from the Dwyers, possibly by marriage to William Peace in 1813.  <br /><br />Before 1824, Great College Street was then known simply as 'College Street' and was acquired by Lewis Hertslet, the librarian and editor of state papers, whose home it was to remain for the 46 years to his death. Hertslet was the eldest son of Jean Louis Pierre Hertslet (formerly Hiertzelet) a Swiss national who settled in England and in May 1797 became a King's Messenger.  Lewis Hertslet died at Great College Street on the 15th March 1870. He was survived by his wife, Mary Spencer Hertslet. <br /><br />By 1876 the house was acquired by another civil servant, George Frere, whose widow, Margaret, lived there until her death in the mid-1890s.<br /><br />The London Post Office directories for 1896 list the occupant of Great College Street as the sportsman and politician, the Rt. Hon. Alfred Lyttelton.  Alfred and Edith Lyttelton had two children. One of these, Oliver Lyttelton afterwards 1st Viscount Chandos, was living at  Great College Street in 1922. He was then a captain in the Grenadier Guards, a regiment with which he had served during the First World War, where he met Winston Churchill.  He entered Churchill's war coalition cabinet as President of the Board of Trade in 1940 where he was responsible for clothes' rationing. In 1942 he succeeded Lord Beaverbrook as Minister of Production. He served in various other political capacities, latterly as Secretary of State for the Colonies, a position he resigned in 1954 on being created Viscount Chandos. His later life was spent in business. He was the first Chairman of the National Theatre, for the establishment of which both his parents had been active campaigners. <br /> <br />In 1928 Dame Edith Lyttelton was sharing some part of Great College Street with Captain Arthur Oswald James Hope (1897-1958), a Conservative Member of Parliament for Nuneaton from 1924-1929 and for Birmingham Aston from 1931-1939. <br /><br />From about 1932 until at least the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Great College Street was the London town-house of the Rt. Hon. Sir John Colin Campbell Davidson (1889-1970), afterwards 1st Viscount Davidson, then a member of parliament for Hemel Hempstead. The street was popular with politicians because of its closeness to the division bells of parliament.  Nos.15, 17 & 19 were also occupied by MP's during this period.<br /><br />Davidson shared Great College Street with his wife, Frances, who succeeded him as Member of Parliament for Hemel Hempstead, canvassing at the by-election on horseback. She retained the seat until 1959. For a short time after the 1945 election she was the only female Conservative MP in the House of Commons.  In 1963 she was created a life peer as Baroness Northchurch  She and her husband were the first husband and wife to be made peers and to be able to sit together in the House of Lords.       <br /><br />Post-war, Great College Street passed into use as offices with the firm of Thicknesse & Hull, who during the 1960's shared some portion of it with the architects, Caroe & Partners. They still occupied the property as late as 1984.<br /><br /><b>Location</b><br /><br />Great College Street runs in an east to west direction linking Abingdon Street/ Millbank to the east with Tufton Street to the west and is situated south of College Gardens.

"05/09/2024","5 bedroom terraced house for sale in Soho Square, Soho, London, W1D","A rare opportunity to acquire a Grade II* Listed freehold building overlooking the iconic Soho Square.<br /><br /><b>Description</b><br /><br />A rare opportunity to acquire a Grade II* Listed freehold building overlooking the iconic Soho Square.<br /><br />The building dates back to 1677, but was extensively rebuilt in 1768 as an upmarket townhouse.<br /><br />Since it has been home to numerous aristocrats including Sir Comport Fytche, the 2nd Baronet of Eltham, George Mackenzie, the 3rd Earl of Cromarty and in the latter part of the eighteenth Century, the Neapolitan envoy to London. Today, the building is Grade II* listed and is set out as offices and production studios with ancillary areas. It currently provides 6,236 Sq Ft of internal space arranged over lower ground, ground and three upper floors. The property is accessed via an attractive ground floor reception area and is serviced with air-conditioning and a lift to all floors.<br /><br />13 Soho Square is a Grade II* listed building located within the Soho Conservation Area and the Core Central Activities Zone. The property comprises of lower ground, ground and first to third floor levels. The building is currently occupied as office accommodation, therefore will attract SDLT at 5% of the purchase price. <br /><br />The consented scheme comprises detailed plans for the conversion of the building into a superb five-bedroom townhouse with a truly prestigious and unique address. The building will benefit from a new roof terrace, an enlarged roof lantern and a range of characterful original features. <br /><br />Proposed accommodation includes: reception room, family room, dining room, living room, kitchen, five en-suite bedrooms, dressing room, entertainment room, study, rear roof terrace off principal suite, storage and plant/utility room and replacement of the existing elevator serving all floors up to the new roof terrace.<br /><br />In 2021 Planning permission was granted by Westminster City Council for change of use to a single family dwelling (Use Class C3), with alterations to all floor levels including integration of a large floor roof terrace and replacement roof lantern. Internal alterations are proposed throughout the building including to the main staircase and incorporating environmental improvements. <br /><br />Application is filed under reference number 20/06844/FULL. Listed building consent was simultaneously granted under reference number 20/06845/LBC. <br /><br />Initial works have already begun at the property to implement the 2021 planning permission for residential use and these works may lawfully continue. <br /><br />The illustrated CGI’s give a very clear insight in to the proposed scheme by architecture, design and construction specialists BCS, who have fully costed the development program and are ready to begin the build for an incoming purchaser. They can also of course adapt the design to one’s specific taste. BCS Builders -  <br /><br />Office buildings in Westminster with planning consent for conversion to residential use are becoming increasingly rare, given Westminster City Council’s proposals to amend policy in 2015 to resist the loss of office floor space to residential uses. A further benefit to having consent from commercial to residential allows for VAT to be charged at 5% for all building materials and construction costs*. <br /><br /><br />*Please note that there are CGI images included in the photo gallery<br /><br /><b>Location</b><br /><br />Soho Square dates back to the late 17th Century when it formed the centrepiece of the Earl of St Alban’s development in Soho. Today the Square remains a focal point in the north-eastern corner of Soho and it retains many of its original historical features, including several listed buildings and two 19th century churches which impart an air of elegance to its setting.<br /><br />With a colourful history as a hotspot for nightlife, theatre and entertainment, Soho has evolved into a thriving commercial hub and a fashionable, cosmopolitan and up-market residential district. The area boasts a superb range of amenities, including some of London’s trendiest bars, restaurants and Member’s clubs such as Soho House, The Groucho Club, Dean Street Town House and The Box. It is bordered by the world-class retailing streets of Oxford and Regent Street, but also offers several key retail locations of its own including Carnaby Street and the Liberty Department Store. The smaller side streets are home to a number of high-end retailers and boutiques including Sunspel, APC, Paul Smith and L’Estrange.<br /><br />Soho is also an internationally renowned office location, particularly for occupiers from the creative sectors such as media, advertising and technology. Tenants include 20th Century Fox, Tiger Aspect Films, M&C Saatchi and Twitter. In recent years, this demand has expanded to financial and corporate occupiers and Soho is now a worthy competitor to nearby Mayfair and St James’s for employers seeking to attract a creative and cosmopolitan workforce.<br /><br />The property occupies a prime position on the northern side of Soho Square, facing south onto the attractive gardens and the iconic Tudorbethan hut at its centre. Due to its vibrancy and its many amenities for residents and it’s superb transport connectivity, Soho is now perceived to be one of the West End’s most desirable places to live for both domestic and international buyers. With limited development opportunities, the residential market is therefore resilient. The area benefits from superb transport connectivity. <br /><br />Tottenham Court Road, Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus stations are a short walk away, providing access to the Bakerloo, Central, Northern, Piccadilly and Victoria lines. In addition, there are numerous bus routes in the area serving Greater London. Tottenham Court Road station, which is approximately 200m from the subject property, is a major interchange for the brand new and recently opened Elizabeth Line. <br /><br />The area around Tottenham Court Road is perhaps the main beneficiary of the regenerative benefits of this new infrastructure, with numerous developments and public realm improvements.<br /><br />Square Footage: 6,236 sq ft<br /><br />","Terraced","6236","5","6","new","£7,650,000"

Bound by Aybrook, Moxon, Cramer and St. Vincent streets, Marylebone Square is reintroducing a long-lost local street pattern to the area.<br /><br />Marylebone Square is a collection of 54 high-end apartments, carefully chosen boutiques and restaurants, and a versatile community hall.<br /><br />Known for its distinctive red-brick Georgian architecture, Marylebone is a district that has carefully preserved its past – and Marylebone Square is a sensitive addition. A contemporary interpretation of a classic London mansion block, it blends into its historic home with a subtle modernity that enhances its surroundings. Externally, the building is a rich palette of glazed terracotta, with intricate yet robust cast-metal balustrades adding a European sensibility to the design. “It was designed with a singular vision,” says lead architect Simon Bowden, “so it has a cohesive quality – and a distinct character that’s strengthened by the robustness of the natural materials.”<br /><br />A glorious five-level, glass-canopied courtyard forms the architectural centrepiece of Marylebone Square, welcoming in sunlight and protecting you and your neighbours should the weather turn. Paved with granite and lined with tall-stemmed, silver birch trees, the airy atrium garden is your sanctuary away from the hubbub. An elliptical lily pond reflects the sky and breezeways, contributing to the sense of solace and quietude.<br /><br />For ambitious individuals, well-heeled couples or growing families, Marylebone Square is the perfect home for those looking for high-quality living in a comfortable environment. Refined, elegant and intuitively designed, the apartments and penthouses are generously spacious yet warmly intimate. Floor-to-ceiling windows and glass sliding doors mean the living space is always aglow with natural light – and the airy, open-plan layout makes it an ideal place for get-togethers. Ranging from one-bed to three-bed layouts, spaces are tailored to occupants – making each space an inimitable home.<br /><br />At Marylebone, you are perfectly placed. Paddington and Euston stations are a short ride away, while Baker Street and Marylebone stations are right on your doorstep. Bond Street underground is a five-minute walk down the road, where the Elizabeth line will connect you to Heathrow Airport or Paris via the Eurostar.

"06/09/2024","6 bedroom house for sale in Liverpool Road, Islington, London, N1, United Kingdom, N1","Discreetly positioned away from the street stands an exceptional Victorian building with a rich and storied history. Originally built as a warehouse this property has the potential to be transformed into a wonderful trophy home and offers a secure and secluded sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Having formerly been used as an exhibition space, a workshop and a performing arts space, a succession of artists have frequented the site over the years including David Bowie and Terence Donovan.   <br /><br /><br /><br />Originally constructed in 1906, the property is currently arranged as 12 individual units within the large warehouse but the extraordinary space has the potential to be transformed into a one-of-a-kind home. The existing main building has four levels, including a flat roof terrace, that are large lateral floor spaces each equivalent to a full-size tennis court. Despite its storied past the building is not listed and the large rooms and planning permission, which has already been granted, create a wealth of options on how to transform the space. This is an exciting opportunity to re-imagine the whole scheme.   <br /><br /><br /><br />The possibilities for what a new and reimagined scheme could look like include a cinema room, a gym, and a swimming pool as well as transforming the roof terrace which benefits from exceptional views of the Georgian houses the area is famed for, and the city of London in the distance. Permission has been granted to excavate the basement to create more square footage. The current owners have worked extensively with the highly lauded architect James Engle to explore different options on how the home could be transformed. Alternatively, permission has been granted to knock down the building and construct three modern townhouses.   <br /><br /><br /><br />Access is via a private gated archway with off-street parking meaning the site is particularly quiet and private for this part of London. The plot is in an excellent position in the Barnsbury Conservation Area, close to Islington High Street, with its wonderful boutique shops and world-famous restaurants. King's Cross and Saint Pancras stations with their convenient transportation links are a 15-minute taxi ride away, and cultural attractions like the British Library and Central Saint Martins University are within walking distance via the Regents Canal towpath.","House","12809","6","6","new","£6,950,000"
