# Python Deliverable Exercises

Thanks for taking your time to check this out.
This is a collection of exercises to get started with Python.
The exercises are meant to be run from 'main.py'.
Please, do so, as some of them won't work if run directly,
as they import functions from 'functions.py' in the root folder.
Yep, still figuring this out...

1. From the PYTHON folder in the terminal:
   Run the Exercise '4.2 Python Template' via `python3 Session_4/Exercise_2/python_template.py`.
   This will create a 'project_x' folder with a virtual environment inside of it.

2. Still within the PYTHON folder, activate the virtual environment
   via `source project_x/.venv/bin/activate`.

3. Now run 'main.py' via `python3 main.py`.
   
Any feedback is appreciated üôèüèº
