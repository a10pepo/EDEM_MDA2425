Hello! I'm founder of [@hackclubnmit](https://github.com/hackclubnmit) and love building softwares, automating my workflows, self-hosting all my services on personal servers (mostly on custom build Raspberry Pi clusters with ICE Tower Coolerü•∂), developing algo-trading scripts, managing my entire life on Notion and reading a lot of newsletters on system design choices of big techs. From design to development I love the entire process of building software. I focus on maintainability, performance, and security with all of my projects and try to follow a lot of best practices. Following best practices early on is the way to go and I'm a huge supporter of it.
