The rivalry between Rafa Nadal and Roger Federer has transcended the boundaries of tennis, becoming one of the greatest in the history of sports. The duels between the Spanish and Swiss tennis players reached their climax, especially for the former, on July 6, 2008, the day a Wimbledon final was played that for many is the best match ever seen in the history of tennis. That day, both contenders vied for a Grand Slam, with an epic victory for Nadal, the underdog, after five hours of thrilling tennis, with several interruptions and a triumph almost at night that goes directly into the annals of sports.

In the words of John McEnroe, who is by no means a nobody in the world of tennis, we are talking about "the greatest match ever seen." The American tennis player played great duels against Connors or Lendl, among others, but none like that Nadal-Federer at Wimbledon 2008. Rafa Nadal, some time after savoring a unique victory, took up McEnroe's words, asserting that it was unparalleled. "The most exciting victory of my career."

After two consecutive finals, in 2006 and 2007, with the same contenders and one winner, Roger Federer, the Swiss tennis player returned to the title match at Wimbledon against a Rafa Nadal with a thirst for revenge. The Mallorcan's progression on grass courts had led him to be considered clearly the second favorite behind the king Federer, but that summer Sunday in 2008 something was going to change in world tennis.

After two consecutive finals, in 2006 and 2007, with the same contenders and one winner, Roger Federer, the Swiss tennis player returned to the title match at Wimbledon against a Rafa Nadal with a thirst for revenge. The Mallorcan's progression on grass courts had led him to be considered clearly the second favorite behind the king Federer, but that summer Sunday in 2008 something was going to change in world tennis.

To put what happened into context, it must be said that Roger Federer was a practically unbeatable player on grass, but that Rafa Nadal, with a game much less adaptable, in theory, to the surface, had dented the Swiss tennis player's morale. We came, a month earlier, from an overwhelming thrashing of Federer by Nadal in the Roland Garros final, and at Wimbledon, although equality was going to be a key factor in the match, the result would end up being the same.

The match lasted 4 hours and 48 minutes, although in actual time it was much longer due to several rain delays that added drama to the spectacle. Some time ago, Wimbledon made the decision to cover the Centre Court of the All England Club – and Court 1 – with a retractable roof and artificial light, but in 2008, neither existed. The match began at 2:36 PM and it wasn't until 9:16 PM that Rafa Nadal could celebrate the most epic victory of his career at that time, with a final score of 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5), 6-7 (8), and 9-7.

This is how Rafa Nadal's victory unfolded:

Nadal won the first two sets 6-4, with excellent tennis in terms of tactics and intelligence. In the third, with Nadal leading 5-4 and Federer serving, we experienced the first rain delay. Roger benefited, as he managed his nerves and forced a tie-break which he won. In the fourth set, the same outcome, in the tie-break and with a Federer victory. Impossible to be more epic... or not.

In the fifth and decisive set, then without a tie-break for that set, the game was interrupted again by rain, with the score at 2-2 and 40-40. "Calm down, Toni. I'm not going to lose, he might beat me but I'm not going to lose," Rafa told his uncle in the locker room, as Toni himself recounts in his book Todo se puede entrenar (Everything Can Be Trained). Nadal had learned his lesson and decided to go all out. Federer did the same.

Thus, the games went by without a break until at 7-7, Federer didn't have his best game, and the best competitor in history, Rafael Nadal Parera, was waiting for him to achieve a service break that would be decisive in completing an otherworldly triumph in the best match in history. After almost five hours and practically in the dark, Nadal threw himself onto the Centre Court grass at Wimbledon and burst into tears as his first conquest in London became a reality.
