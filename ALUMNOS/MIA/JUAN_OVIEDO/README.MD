### Glad to see you here! &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=iampavangandhi.iampavangandhi&style=flat-square&color=0088cc)

I am a future data scientist currently doing a Master's Degree in AI in EDEM 🚀. 
At this moment I'm working as a family doctor for the Public Health in Valencia, Spain. 

I have a passion for problem-solving and pioneering first-principle thinking, driven by purpose and fueled by the challenge of finding solutions.

I'm an explorer of new tech, an avid learner, and a problem-solver at heart. 

Feel free to connect with me @ovjuanc for all things tech or just to say hello! Let's shape the future of tech together. 🌟
