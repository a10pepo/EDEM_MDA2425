# Spark EDEM MDA 2324

In this repo we have the code to develop the deliverable Spark exercise. To raise the Spark containers go into the docker folder and launch:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Also we leave here the command we will use to launch our Spark apps:
```sh
bash /spark/bin/spark-submit --master local opt/project/src/python/example.py
```

For more detailed info about the exercise please refer to the PDF included in this repo 4_diy_etl.pdf.

Thanks :)
