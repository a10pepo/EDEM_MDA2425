## DBT

### Create two reports

##### 1. Payment  method status
Create a report “rep_payment_method_status.sql”, to calculate the total amount failed and success per each payment_method.

##### 2. Returned orders
Create a report “rep_returned_orders” to show the orders returned, the report should include the following columns: order_id - customer_id - order_date - status - first_name	last_name - amount. 

### Deliverables

- 2 screenshots: one from each sql query.
- 2 screenshots: from PGAdmin where the new table/report is shown (5-10 lines).
